# üö∂ Enhanced Movement System

## ‚ú® New Features

### Step-Based Movement
- **One click = One step**: Each movement command makes the robot take a single step
- **Smooth animation**: Robot smoothly interpolates between positions
- **Walking animation**: Legs swing naturally during movement
- **Slight bounce**: Adds realistic up-down motion while walking

### Stable at Rest
- **Legs stay still**: When not moving, legs remain in neutral position (no swinging)
- **Gentle arm sway**: Arms have minimal idle animation for a natural look
- **No continuous drift**: Robot stays exactly where you place it

### Direction-Aware Movement
- **Forward/Backward**: Moves in the direction the robot is facing
- **Left/Right**: Strafes sideways relative to robot's orientation
- **Rotation**: Turn left/right changes which way the robot faces

## üéÆ How It Works

### Movement Commands

**Forward** - Takes one step forward in the direction robot is facing
```
Click "Forward" ‚Üí Robot walks one step ‚Üí Stops and stands still
```

**Backward** - Takes one step backward
```
Click "Backward" ‚Üí Robot walks one step back ‚Üí Stops
```

**Left/Right** - Strafes one step to the side
```
Click "Left" ‚Üí Robot sidesteps left ‚Üí Stops
```

**Rotate** - Turns 15 degrees (no walking animation)
```
Click "Rotate Left" ‚Üí Robot turns ‚Üí Ready to walk in new direction
```

### Animation States

1. **Idle** (at rest)
   - Legs: Straight, no movement
   - Arms: Gentle 5¬∞ sway
   - Body: Stable

2. **Walking** (during step)
   - Legs: 25¬∞ swing, alternating
   - Arms: 20¬∞ swing, opposite to legs
   - Body: Slight bounce (0.1 units)
   - Duration: ~1.25 seconds per step

3. **Dancing**
   - Legs: 30¬∞ swing
   - Arms: Full swing
   - Continuous motion

## üîß Technical Details

### Walking Animation System

```python
# Step size (adjustable)
step_size = 0.5  # units per step

# Animation speed
walk_progress += 0.08  # Position interpolation
walk_cycle += 0.3      # Leg swing speed

# Smooth easing (smoothstep function)
t_smooth = t * t * (3 - 2 * t)
```

### Movement Calculation

The robot moves relative to its rotation:
```python
angle_rad = math.radians(rotation[1])

# Forward movement
x = position[0] - sin(angle_rad) * step_size
z = position[2] - cos(angle_rad) * step_size
```

### State Management

- `is_walking`: True during step animation
- `walk_progress`: 0.0 to 1.0 (completion percentage)
- `walk_cycle`: Continuous counter for leg swing
- `target_position`: Where the robot is walking to
- `start_position`: Where the robot started from

## üéØ Usage Examples

### Walking in a Square

1. Click "Forward" 4 times
2. Click "Rotate Right"
3. Click "Forward" 4 times
4. Click "Rotate Right"
5. Click "Forward" 4 times
6. Click "Rotate Right"
7. Click "Forward" 4 times

### Exploring the Space

1. Rotate to face desired direction
2. Click movement buttons to take steps
3. Robot walks naturally with each click
4. Stops automatically after each step

### Combining Actions

- **Can't jump while walking**: Jump is disabled during step animation
- **Can rotate while idle**: Instant rotation when standing still
- **Wave/Dance override walking**: Special animations take priority

## ‚öôÔ∏è Customization

### Adjust Step Size

In `character_3d.py`, line 37:
```python
self.step_size = 0.5  # Change this value
```
- Smaller = shorter steps (e.g., 0.3)
- Larger = longer steps (e.g., 0.8)

### Adjust Walking Speed

In `update_animation()`, line 281:
```python
self.walk_progress += 0.08  # Increase for faster walking
```
- 0.05 = Slow walk
- 0.08 = Normal walk (default)
- 0.12 = Fast walk

### Adjust Leg Swing

In `update_animation()`, line 282:
```python
self.walk_cycle += 0.3  # Increase for faster leg swing
```

In `draw_leg()`, line 215:
```python
glRotatef(math.sin(self.walk_cycle + side * math.pi) * 25, 1, 0, 0)
#                                                         ^^
#                                                    Swing angle
```
- 15 = Small swing
- 25 = Normal swing (default)
- 35 = Large swing

### Adjust Idle Arm Movement

In `draw_arm()`, line 182:
```python
glRotatef(math.sin(self.arm_rotation + side * math.pi) * 5, 1, 0, 0)
#                                                         ^
#                                                    Idle sway angle
```
- 0 = Completely still
- 5 = Gentle sway (default)
- 10 = More noticeable sway

## üé® Animation Timeline

```
Step Animation (1.25 seconds):
0.00s: [Start] Robot at start position, legs neutral
0.15s: Left leg forward, right leg back, arms swinging
0.30s: Peak of leg swing
0.45s: Legs crossing neutral position
0.60s: Right leg forward, left leg back
0.75s: Peak of opposite leg swing
0.90s: Legs returning to neutral
1.00s: Robot reaches target position
1.25s: [End] Legs fully neutral, robot stopped
```

## üìä Performance

- **60 FPS**: Smooth animation at 60 frames per second
- **Interpolation**: Smoothstep easing for natural acceleration/deceleration
- **State-based**: Efficient state machine prevents conflicts
- **Non-blocking**: Can queue next command after step completes

## üêõ Troubleshooting

**Robot doesn't move when I click**
- Check if robot is already walking (wait for step to complete)
- Verify command is reaching the robot (check console)

**Movement is too fast/slow**
- Adjust `walk_progress` increment (line 281)
- Adjust `step_size` (line 37)

**Legs still moving at rest**
- Check that `is_walking` is False
- Verify `walk_cycle` resets to 0 after walking

**Robot moves in wrong direction**
- Rotation affects movement direction
- Use "Rotate" commands to face desired direction first
